## The Song Clip Guessing Game

This game has three different game modes to test how well someone's music knowledge is based off a 
small clip of a random song. The user can choose from several different genres to test their knowledge
and get scores to see how they do compared to their friends. There are three different game modes, 
each with their own separate methods for scoring, but they are all based off of 10 song clips per game. 

### Game Modes:

#### Novice

Casual players trying to pass time throughout the day or enhance their music knowledge can play this mode 
to figure out their knowledge of a certain genre of music. This mode gives multiple choice options, so the 
user has a range of options to guess or choose from before answering. They are given their scores out of 10, 
since they are given 10 song choices to choose from. 

#### Insane

Hardcore players that are attempting speedruns and high score leaderboards will choose the insane mode. 
This mode gives score multipliers through the duration of the guess, so the faster the guess the higher the 
score. It also has a text box, so the user would have to know the name of the song exactly to get it correct.
A correct answer is 100 points, and an almost instant answer can go up to a 5x multiplier. 

#### Lightning

This is a very fast speed mode similar to insane mode, but without the points system involved. This mode 
records how quickly you can guess 10 songs in a given amount of time. Your high score gets recorded as a 
time, where the lower the time the better the rating. If any of your guesses are incorrect, your game 
ends and you cannot record a time.
